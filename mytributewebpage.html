            <h2>Here is a not so interesting time line of how she has spent her life so far:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>2003</span> -Born in federal medical center, Gombe state, Nigeria. Weighed about 8kg!!!(God bless my mother).</li>
                <li><span>2005</span> -Started school early, attended nursery school for two years (i almost never spoke, people thought i was mute).</li>
                <li><span>2008</span> -Attended primary school for five years (ahhh! those days of looking forward to lunch break like that was our main purpose there).<br>
                Fell in love with anime during my last year.
               </li>
                <li><span>2015</span> -Went to secondary for six years (OMG! i laughed so hard during those times, made some really nice friends that will be here for a really long time and achieved things i  never thought i could).<br>  
                Had my first boyfriend in junior secondary, lost my virginity in the....oh no sh!t thats not me (thought you'll discover something spicy here ehh?!!).<br>
                 Well the only spicy-related thing here is my interest in food and spicy ones too. I was obsessed with food network, growing up (became slightly obese because of it).<br> 
                 Had my first love confession in year 2 (intense is an understatement), oh it was also my first rejection (oh don't get it wrong i was the one that received the confession).<br>
                 Jumped school fence once to avoid extra-lessons (a delinquent moment).<br>
                 Almost had surgery for appendicitis (scary!!!).<br>
                 I have to say the years i spent in secondary school was so much more engaging and fun than others.<br>
                 There is a lot to remember and to talk about, plus i wouldn't want my fingers to slip and end up typing my deepest darkest dirtiest secrets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2019</span> -Finally! university! i felt so proud and excited. Currently a 300 level biological sciences student (for the past 4 years, i need not explain this to the majority of you why).<br>
                    I most definitely lost most of my extra weight during my first year(damn! it was stressful!).<br>
                    I met this girl that i was certain she was Einsteins' lost african descedant, and probably gonna be our president one day (my chibi tomodachi).<br>
                    <span>2020</span> was the sh!t(and thats it!).<br>
                    No comments on <span>2022</span> yet (we still here).
